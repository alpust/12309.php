 DESCRIPTION:
12309.php is advanced webshell with the main aim at executing shell commands in all possible ways. it has some additional functions though.

 FEATURES:
 - you could choose desired function to execute code with (+pcntl_exec +ssh2_exec)
 - on old php versions (such as 5.1.6, 5.2.9) this script could bypass open_basedir and read other users` files (if you`re running it with webserver`s rights, i.e. kind of apache-mpm-prefork or -worker, not kind of -itk or -peruser).
 - backconnect/bind port on PHP, Python, and "classic" perl and C backconnect/bind
 - fully interactive backconnect on Python (yes, you can run even vim & mc via backconnect!)
 - nice extra functions
